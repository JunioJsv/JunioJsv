  I am a self-taught developer with extensive professional experience. I am well-versed in full-stack development, primarily within the realm of mobile applications and back-end APIs. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on projects with a wide range of implementations, gaining significant experience in software development.

I have a solid knowledge of technologies such as Kotlin, Java, Android SDK, Flutter, MySQL, Spring, Node.js, C/C++, and Dart. I am committed to continuous improvement and acquiring new skills, a commitment that drives me to constantly evolve as a developer.
