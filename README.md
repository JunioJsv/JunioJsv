Software Developer with over 4 years of experience in Flutter, Kotlin, and Android SDK.

Throughout my career, I have worked with multidisciplinary teams from architectural planning to the production launch of projects that exceeded 500,000 downloads. I participated in the migration of legacy applications to Flutter and served as a technical reference within the team, assisting colleagues with bugs and questions.

I have experience with cross-platform software, geolocation, graphical rendering with OpenGL, automated testing, CI/CD, and Agile methodologies.

Although my specialty is the mobile ecosystem, I also have experience with other stacks, such as C++/Qt/OpenGL and backend using the Spring Boot and Laravel frameworks. This reinforces my agnostic view of languages and frameworks in the development cycle, enabling me to collaborate on complete solutions, from conception to final product.

I am seeking challenges where I can lead high-impact deliveries and constantly evolve as a software developer.

Technical Skills:
Flutter, Kotlin, Dart, Java, C/C++, TypeScript, MySQL, Android SDK, OpenGL, OpenGLES, AWS, Spring Boot, RESTful APIs, Firebase, CI/CD, Git, Agile (Scrum), SOLID, Unit Tests, Integration Tests, E2E Tests
